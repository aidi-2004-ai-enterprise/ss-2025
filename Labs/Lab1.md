# Comprehensive Real-World Git Workflow Lab Assignment

## Scenario
You are part of a development team.

You will be in a team of 3 people.

1 person will create an empty public repository through github's UI.:


Each team (3 members) will fork this repository, collaborate on features, and submit pull requests (PRs) to their team fork. 

Youâ€™ll simulate professional workflows, including branching, code reviews, merging, rebasing, undoing changes, unstaging etc.

## Objectives
- Install Git and set up a GitHub account.
- Fork and manage a team repository using GitHub Flow.
- Implement realistic workflows: branching, PRs, code reviews, merging, rebasing, undoing changes etc.
- Collaborate in teams, including pair programming and code review metrics.
- Create learning artifacts (cheatsheet, workflow diagram, branch visualization).
- Evaluate Git practices and document retrospectives.

## Activity

### Part 1: Setting Up Git and GitHub
1. **Install Git**:
   - **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com), install with defaults. Verify: `git --version`.
   - **macOS**: Run `brew install git`. Verify: `git --version`.
   - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: Run `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt install git`. Verify: `git --version`.

2. **Create a GitHub Account**:
   - Sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com) and confirm your email.
   - Add an SSH key (Settings > SSH and GPG keys).

3. **Configure Git**:
   - Set user details:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
     git config --global init.defaultBranch main
     ```
   - Verify: `git config --list`.

### Part 2: Team Setup and Repository Fork
1. **Form Teams**:
   - Instructor assigns teams of 3. Designate one member as the **Owner**.

2. **Add teammates to Repository** (Fork Owner):
   - Add team members as collaborators (Settings > Collaborators > Add people).
   - Clone the repository made by the owner.
   - Add upstream remote (optional):

4. **Set Up PR Template** (Fork Owner):
   - Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
     ```markdown
     ## What Changes Were Made
     Describe the changes in this PR.

     ## Why These Changes Were Needed
     Explain the purpose or issue addressed.

     ## Testing Performed
     List tests or steps to verify the changes.

     ## Screenshots (if applicable)
     Attach relevant screenshots.
     ```
   - Add, Commit and push:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p .github
     # Add pull_request_template.md
     git add .github/pull_request_template.md
     git commit -m "chore: added PR template"
     git push -u origin main
     ```

5. **Set up a venv**:
    - Use UV and create a pyproject.toml file which will be used to create a virtual environment.
    - Ensure xgboost and pandas verion is pinned to the latest semver.

    Push the pyproject.toml, and uv.lock file to the remote repository.

5. **Create a main.py** (Fork Owner):
    - Create a script that loads data from penguins dataset.

### Part 3: GitHub Flow and Workflows - All working on the same file (Dependant changes)
Adopt **GitHub Flow**: Feature branches are created from `main`, PRs are reviewed and merged quickly, and deployments are frequent. Each member works on a task:

```
    - split the dataset (Person A)
    - Create a default xgboost model (Person B)
    - do a .fit() on the dataset (Person C)
```

#### Workflow 1: Creating a Feature Branch and PR
1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Update `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```
   - Create a branch (e.g., `feat-<your-name>-<task>`):
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feat-<your-name>-<task>
     ```

2. **Make Changes**:
    - Edit the `main.py` based on your role:

    ```
        - split the dataset (Person A)
        - Create a default xgboost model (Person B)
        - do a .fit() on the dataset (Person C)
    ```


3. **Push and Create PR**:
   - Push:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin feat-<your-name>-task
     ```
   - Create a PR targeting `main` using the PR template. Assign a teammate as reviewer.

#### Workflow 2: Reviewing a PR
1. **Review** (Reviewer):
   - Check **Files changed**, leave two comments (e.g., style suggestion, logic question).
   - Approve or request changes.

2. **Address Feedback** (Author):
   - Make changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout feat-<your-name>-task
     # Edit files
     git add <files>
     git commit -m "fix: addressed review feedback"
     git push origin feat-<your-name>-task
     ```

#### Workflow 3 Merging a PR:

Each person A, B and C will create a PR which is merged into main. 
You will run into issues here because we cannot merge all 3 into main at once. 
You will need to create a C into B and B into A and then A into main.

This is an example of how working on 1 file with lots of dependancies can lead to complex merging techniques.


#### Workflow 4 - All working on parallel changes (independant changes)

Now that you've merged 1 branch into main.py, each person will work on their own file:

Each person will create their own new main.py and open a PR that is not merged into main. 

You must show the following:

Start by ensuring your local main.py is synced with remote before you create your new branch. 

Add a commit to your main.py and push the changes.

Workflow 5:

The owner will update the main.py 

Workflow 6:

The PRs created in workflow 4, which have not been merged yet should be rebased with the latest main.py.
